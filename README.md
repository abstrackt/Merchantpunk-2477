WWW App course project - Typescript based game about hardships of selling cola and snacks in the outer space.

The game consists of two main screens, a login screen which allows the user to start up the game or log in to his account. When not logged in, the user can start a session using a default scenario. Creating an account allows the user to upload new scenarios to the game server (for formatting of new scenarios refer to the initial_data.json file).

Your aim is to accumulate as much money as you can by transporting goods between various planets in the system. You command a fleet of ships which you can manage from the ship menu. You can also check the current prices of goods on a given planet by clicking it's icon on the minimap. You can track your fleet's movement in real-time on the minimap.

Since the game requires the server to function you would need to run your own instance and install the necessary modules if you'd want to play the game yourself. All code and Selenium tests are available in the repo.
